# Intermediate_Java_Programming 

## Course Description

Deepen your understanding of the Java programming language, and start writing programs that are more sophisticated and professional. Learn how to save data permanently on a disk by writing it to a sequential data file. See how to read the file to get the data back and process it. Organize information using multiple classes in Java's class hierarchy and inheritance. Explore some of the hundreds of classes that are built into the Java language. Find out how to create GUI applications in Java using tools like windows, menus, buttons, text boxes, check boxes, scroll bars, and other GUI tools.

Over the six weeks of this course, you'll build several complete applications that combine these concepts. You'll also use the knowledge you gain to solve programming problems included with the lessons--problems designed to help you master all the principles you learn.
